# Disney + 2.0 App

It is an app to show movies inspired by Disney + made in order to train and give the best possible user experience.

The adoption of design patterns focused on custom hooks and a feature-based or modular architecture in our application offers multiple significant advantages. Custom hooks promote code reuse, allowing encapsulation and sharing of state logic among various components, which saves time, reduces code duplication and improves overall productivity.
The modular architecture allows us to separate the underlying logic from the UI-related code in our components, making the components lighter and facilitating collaboration between developers working on different aspects of the application.
